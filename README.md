# Underwater Explorer

A 2D underwater scene including a diver, fish, and seaweed. All components are built using hierarchical modeling. Rendering is done with WebGL. To run, simply open `main.html` in any browser that supports the HTML canvas element. Many aspects of the scene are customaizable, including fish swim and tail speeds, diver speeds, diver bubble speed and frequency, and more!
